# Self-driving Car Nano-Degree Core Curriculum
This section consists of all the lessons and projects you need to complete in order to receive your certificate.

## PART 1
Computer Vision and Deep Learning
In this term, you'll become an expert in applying Computer Vision and Deep Learning on automotive problems. You will teach the car to detect lane lines, predict steering angle, and more all based on just camera data!
  - Project: Finding Lane Lines on the Road
  - Project: Traffic Sign Classifier
  - Project: Behavioral Cloning
  - Project: Advanced Lane Finding
  - Project: Vehicle Detection and Tracking
  Estimated time: 90 days

## PART 2
Sensor Fusion, Localization, and Control
In this term, you'll learn how to use an array of sensor data to perceive the environment and control the vehicle. You'll evaluate sensor data from camera, radar, lidar, and GPS, and use these in closed-loop controllers that actuate the vehicle.
  - Project: Extended Kalman Filters
  - Project: Unscented Kalman Filters
  - Project: Kidnapped Vehicle
  - Project: PID Controller
  - Project: Model Predictive Control
  Estimated time: 89 days

## PART 3
Path Planning, Concentrations, and Systems
In this term, you'll learn how to plan where the vehicle should go, how the vehicle systems work together to get it there, and you'll perform a deep-dive into a concentration of your choice.
  - Project: Path Planning Project
  - Project: Semantic Segmentation (Elective)
  - Project: Functional Safety of a Lane Assistance System (Elective)
  - Project: Programming a Real Self-Driving Car (Group Project)
  Estimated time: 89 days

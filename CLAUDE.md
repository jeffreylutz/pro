# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This is Jeffrey Lutz's professional portfolio repository, primarily consisting of documentation and references to external projects. The repository serves as a central hub for professional credentials, certifications, and links to various code projects hosted elsewhere.

## Repository Structure

- **docs/**: Contains professional documents including resume (PDF/DOCX), certifications, and course completion certificates
- **logs/**: Contains JSON log files (chat.json, post_tool_use.json, pre_tool_use.json, stop.json)
- **README.md**: Main portfolio page with links to external projects and training courses
- **CarND-README.md**: Detailed curriculum and project links for the Self-Driving Car Nano-Degree program
- **OO_DESIGN_README.md**: Notes on Object-Oriented Design principles (SOLID) from Robert Martin's course

## Working with This Repository

Since this is a documentation repository without active code:

1. **No build/test/lint commands** - This repository contains only documentation files
2. **External project work** - When working on actual code projects, navigate to the specific project repositories linked above
3. **Documentation updates** - Focus on maintaining accurate links and updating professional credentials as needed

# Object Oriented Design Course by Object Mentor / Robert Martin

The idea behind OO design is to adhere to the design principles by looking at every class.  If a class violates any of the prinicples, then apply [design patterns](http://...) in order to redesign the class to conform to the OO design prinicples.

OO Design principles: SOLID
- SRP - Single responsibility principle:  A class should have only one reason to change.  
- OCP - Open/Closed Principle:  Software entityes (classes, modules, packages, methods) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
- LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle:  That subtypes must be substitutable for their base types without any side effects.
- ISP - Interface Segregation Principle: Interfaces exist to serve a specific client.  Interfaces should not be designed to serve multiple client types.
- DIP - Dependency Inversion Principle:  High level modules should not directly depend on low level modules.  Instead, high level modules should depend on abstractions (think interfaces) that are injected at runtime.
